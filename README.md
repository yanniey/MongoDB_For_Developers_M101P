#### [Course Link](https://university.mongodb.com/courses/M101P/about)

#### Goal:
 
To build a blog with [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.org/) and [Bottle](http://bottlepy.org/docs/dev/index.html) framework in Python(PyMongo)

Import a JSON file to MongoDB:

```
mongorestore --collection messages --db enron messages.bson
```
See `Final/Final_answers.md` for answers to the final exam.

+ Week 6, completed 7/3/15.

Drivers, impact of replication and Sharding on design and development.

+ Replica set
+ Primary vs. secondary server
+ W & J parameter, Wtimeout
+ Read preference
+ Sharding, shard keys are immutable
+ Config servers


```
rs.slaveOk()
sh.status()
```

 I had some problems with assignment 6.5 which required running a 3-node replica set on my local end. The `validate.py` file had an error message of:

 ```
 Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "validate.py", line 3, in <module>
    eval(compile(base64.b64decode(code), "<string>", 'exec'))
  File "<string>", line 36
    print "usage validate.py -m mongoConnectString"
                                                  ^

```
  Eventually I figured out that it's because my default Python version was Python3,but this course required Python2, so I was able to solve my problem through an easy `python2 validate.py`.

+ Week 4, finished 06/20/2015

	All about indexing. Using indexes, monitoring and understanding performance. Performance in sharded environments.

	Pluggable storage engines: **MMAP**(default) vs. **WiredTiger**

	Storage engines talk to drivers and influence how data is indexed and formated on the hard drive

	How to change default storage engine to Wired Tiger:

	```
	# kill current MongoDB session
	killall mongod
	# make a new directory
	mkdir WT
	# change the storage engine
	mongod --storageEngine wiredTiger
	```

	```
	db.foo.stats()
	```

	Schema Design - Patterns, case studies and tradeoffs. **$Pull**(remove) and **$Push**(insert)

Import Json file into MongoDB


```mongoimport -d school -c students < HW3.1students.json```


HW 3.2 

```
# XXX HW 3.2 Work Here to insert the post

self.posts.insert(post, j=True)
```

```
# XXX HW 3.2 Work here to get the posts

cursor = self.posts.find().sort([('date',-1)]).limit(num_posts)
```

```
# XXX Work here to retrieve the specified post

post = self.posts.find_one({'permalink':permalink})
```


Shell output:

```

  CRUD (Creating, Reading and Updating Data) - Mongo shell, query operators, update operators and a few commands. Create the `user` and `session` class for the blog app


	Use curl to download a json file and read it in python 

	``` 
	curl https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/.json > reddit.json
	cat reddit.json | python -m json.tool | more
	python read_reddit.py
	mongo
	# in mongo shell
	use reddit
	show collections
	db.stories.findOne()
	db.stroies.find().pretty()
	```

	2.1 JS file that creates a database in Mongo
	`mongo < 2.1school.js`

	2.4 Regex
	Mongo regex has an option of case insensitivity `'$options':'i'`

	2.5 Skip, limit, sort 
	order: sort first, then skip, then limit

	2.6 insert_one()

	2.7 insert_many()
	In `people.insert_many(people_to_insert,ordered=False)`, the `ordered=False` does not preserve the data when it's inserted into the database as in `people_to_insert = [andrew,richard]`

	`ordered = True` by default

	2.8 update_one() and update_many()

	2.9 replace_one()
	Cannot use `$set` in `replace_one()`

	2.11 delete_one() and delete_many()

	2.12 find_and_modify(), find_one_and_update()

	HW 2.1

	import json file into MongoDB

	```mongoimport -d students -c grades < grades.json```
